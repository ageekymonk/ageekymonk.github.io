   The fundamental premise of this book is trade is the sole reason why humans
   are progressing and trade alone will help us solve almost all the social
   evils. 

   The author argues ardently that trade is what fundamentally
   differentiates humans from rest of the species and this ability to trade with
   unrelated persons without killing each other helped humans to
   build the ever expanding repository of collective intelligence. The author
   has highlighted that most of the social evils like slavery all has been
   abolished because of trade.
   
   The author has oversimplified the root source of why humans are progressing to
   just trade. Though i tended to agree to most of his views, i would love to
   hear the opposite views as well. Also by oversimplifying it i think he has
   failed to acknowledged other factors that has contributed to our progress.
   
   The author dismisses some of the current challenges involving
   climate changes, viruses, asteroid, human greed, without giving those views its due diligence. 
   I think these pessimistic views are important which will impart us to take in measures 
   otherwise a truly optimist will not consider.

   The authors bold and optimistic language in the whole book i find it bit
   overwhelming and repetitive. The book could have been much shorted. 
   But overall a good book and worth reading and contemplate upon.
