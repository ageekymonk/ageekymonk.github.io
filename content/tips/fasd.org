If you are using cd to change directory then you are doing it wrong. *fasd* is an
alternative tool which will make you 10x faster. fasd maintains a list of
frequently accessed directories and does a fuzzy jump and jumps to that
directory.

* Faster Jump
I have added alias "j" to =fasd_cd -d= fast jump to directories

* Faster open file
I have added alias "vi" to =fasd -f -e 'emacsclient -t'= fast find my recently accessed file and open it.
